India ranked 111th out of 125 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2023, highlighting the critical issue of food insecurity. At the same time, the UN Environment Programme reports that each person in India wastes approximately 55 kg of food per year. To address this paradox, we developed a MERN stack-based food donation website aimed at seamlessly connecting food donors with those in need.

Our platform facilitates easy food donations from individuals or from social gatherings, functions, and restaurants, directly to the needy or through volunteers. By doing so, we aim to significantly reduce food waste and ensure proper food distribution to the underprivileged. Our mission is to minimize unnecessary food waste and promote equitable food distribution, creating a more sustainable and hunger-free society through our innovative digital solution.
